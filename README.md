FaceGuard is an advanced facial recognition attendance system designed to enhance building security while prioritizing privacy. It scans and tracks visitors entering the building, identifying whether they have been there before or are new, but excludes students from scanning for ethical reasons. FaceGuard ensures a secure and seamless way to monitor access while maintaining respect for privacy.
